## Automake initialization of new XMC project

Most of the following explanations how to create a new automake project is perfectly explained on
http://mij.oltrelinux.com/devel/autoconf-automake/

## Initialization
To create a new automake project, two config files and the src directory are necessary:
- configure.ac
- Makefile.am
- src/

## Generate project
Please execute the following commands in order to use automake to create a makefile

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
> aclocal
> autoconf
> automake 
```


## Compile and link

The following command must be executed only to reconfigure the Makefile after the source directory structure has changed.
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
./configure
```

If there are only changes to the source files, it's sufficient to execute
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
make
```


## Install tools
In order to flash, debug and run the program on our XMC4500 ÂµController we have to install eclipse and some addtitional packages.

```
npm install --global xpm@latest
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@latest
```
 
- Download and Install Eclipse from the eclipse.org website
- Install CDT feature
- Open pack manager in eclipse and refresh pack list
- Install pack for XMC4500

The arm gdb debugger is used and selected in eclipse in the Debugger tab. The eclipse textbox shows <br>
${cross_prefix}gdb${cross_suffix} <br>
which is expanded to <br>
arm-none-eabi-gdb

Install SEGGER J-Link Driver <br>

Make sure that Device name is XMC4500-1024


## Blinky application

The blinky application code was originally shown in the following tutorial:
https://embeddedplaygroup.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/its-relax-time-blinky-led/


## Makefile.am 

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
INCLUDE_DIRS    = -Isrc/include
ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4
AM_CFLAGS       = $(INCLUDE_DIRS) -std=c99 -Wall -O0 -g  \
                                  -DXMC4500_F100x1024 \
                                  -mthumb \
                                  -march=armv7-m \
                                  --specs=nosys.specs \
                                  -Wl,--gc-sections

CFLAGS = -g -O0

CC              = arm-none-eabi-gcc
CCAS            = arm-none-eabi-gcc
AM_LDFLAGS      = -g -O0 -Tsrc/linker_script.ld


bin_PROGRAMS = main.bin

main_bin_SOURCES =  src/Startup/system_XMC4500.c \
                    src/Startup/startup_XMC4500.S \
                    src/main.c
```

- std=c99: C99 dialect of C http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language
- Wall: 
- O0: no optimization
- g: include debug symbols
- DXMC4500_F100x1024: value needed during compilations
- mthumb: ARM thumb 32 & 16 bit instruction set
- march=armv7-m: armv7 architecture
